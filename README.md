A simple TensorFlow code that demonstrates learning three simple models:
1. logistic regression, 
2. 2-layer fully connected net, and 
3. convolutional net with two convolutional, one fully connected and an output layer

Prerequisites:
* Python
* [https://www.tensorflow.org](Tensorflow)

If you use Linux or OSX the installation should be pretty smooth via [https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation](pip).

If you use Windows you will not be able to use GPU (for now). For installation instructions see [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PlayingWithTensorFlowOnWindows.aspx](here) taking into account that the at the time of writing of this README the current version is 0.11, so replace 0.8 with 0.11.
