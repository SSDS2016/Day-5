A simple TensorFlow code that demonstrates learning three simple models:

1. logistic regression,
2. net with one fully-connected hidden layer,
3. convolutional net with two hidden convolutional, one hidden fully-connected layer.

Prerequisites:
* Python
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)

If you use Linux or OSX the installation should be pretty smooth via pip ([instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation)).

You can run TensorFlow on Windows via Anaconda ([instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#anaconda-installation))
or Docker
([instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#docker-installation)). 
For installation instructions on Windows 10 see [here](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PlayingWithTensorFlowOnWindows.aspx) taking into account that the at the time of writing of this README the current version is 0.11, so replace 0.8 with 0.11.
Disclaimer: I have not tried to install nor run TensorFlow on Windows.
